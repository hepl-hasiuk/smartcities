Why 65535?
In the program, we use "read_u16()" to read the analog value returned by the pin, where 
"u16" means to read the analog value as an unsigned binary integer of up to 16 bits. The 
maximum value of the 16-bit binary integer is 1111111111111111, which is equal to 65535 
after being converted into decimal form.
